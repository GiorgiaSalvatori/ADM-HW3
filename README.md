This repository contains all the code and explanations for Homework 3 of Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining class. For this homework we have organized all the answers in one file called <b> main.ipynb</b>; the file contains also the two bonus questions. We encountered problems - now solved - regarding the visualization of the main.ipynb notebook on Github, with the error message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?". If it will happen again, the notebook can be viewed using this website: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ </br>
We obtained the data from www.goodreads.com, more precisely from this list made by Goodreads users: https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever?page=1  </br> We downloaded just data from the books in the first 300 pages as requested in the homework instructions. <br>
