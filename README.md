This repository contains all the code and explanations for Homework 3 of Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining class. For this homework we have organized all the answers in one file called <b> main.ipynb</b>; the file contains also the two bonus questions. <br>
We obtained the data from www.goodreads.com, more precisely from this list (https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever?page=1) made by Goodreads users. We downloaded just data from the books in the first 300 pages as requested in the homework instructions. <br>
